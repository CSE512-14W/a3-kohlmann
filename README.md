## TimeLoaf

![](https://files.app.net/cn7fVS2n)

TimeLoaf is a web-based interactive visualization tool built with D3 that visualizes data from the [American Time Use Survey](http://bls.gov/tus/#tables) conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It displays the average number of hours spent (in a 24-hour day) performing one of twelve high-level primary activities for men, women, and both genders, according to either weekdays or weekends and holidays, from 2003 to 2012, as one or more donut charts.

## Running Instructions

TimeLoaf is available online: http://cse512-14w.github.io/a3-kohlmann/

You can also download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` to access TimeLoaf from http://localhost:9000/ on your local machine.
